# DSA210-Project
SabancÄ± University DSA210 Introduction to Data Science Course Fall 2024-2025 Term Project.

# Motivation
This project explores the relationship between my daily screen time, mood, sleep patterns and weather conditions, aiming to uncover patterns that influence mental well-being. In a digital age where technology and environmental factors shape our daily lives, understanding these connections is timely and relevant.

By analyzing my own screen usage, sleep habits and weather conditions, I hope to gain insights into how these elements interact and impact my mental health.

# Data Description
Screen Time: Total usage and time spent in categories from iPhone's Screen Time feature.

Mood: Daily self-assessment on a 1-10 scale.

Sleep Patterns: Total sleep duration (hours) and subjective quality ratings.

Weather: Daily temperature and conditions sourced from a weather app.

# Research Questions
This project aims to address the following questions:

1. How does daily screen time impact mood and mental well-being?
2. Are specific app categories (e.g., social media, entertainment, productivity) more closely associated with changes in mood?
3. What is the relationship between sleep patterns and screen time usage?
4. Do weather conditions (e.g., temperature, sunny or rainy days) influence mood or screen time habits?
5. How do these factors (screen time, sleep, weather) collectively interact to shape daily well-being?
