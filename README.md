# DSA210-Project
SabancÄ± University DSA210 Introduction to Data Science Course Fall 2024-2025 Term Project.

# Motivation
This project explores the relationship between my daily screen time, mood, sleep patterns and weather conditions, aiming to uncover patterns that influence mental well-being. In a digital age where technology and environmental factors shape our daily lives, understanding these connections is timely and relevant.

By analyzing my own screen usage, sleep habits and weather conditions, I hope to gain insights into how these elements interact and impact my mental health.
